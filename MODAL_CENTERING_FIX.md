## Technical Details

### Problem
- Modal dialogs were not properly centered on all screen sizes
- Some modals could cause page scrolling when content was too tall
- Inconsistent modal behavior across different components

### Solution
- Added `overflow-hidden` to all modal container divs to prevent body scrolling
- Ensured all modal content containers have `max-h-[90vh]` to limit height
- Used `overflow-y-auto` on content areas to allow scrolling within the modal when needed
- Maintained consistent padding and spacing

### CSS Classes Applied
```css
/* Modal Container */
.fixed.inset-0.flex.items-center.justify-center.z-50.p-4.overflow-hidden

/* Modal Content */
.max-h-[90vh].overflow-y-auto
```

## Result
- All modal dialogs are now perfectly centered on all screen sizes
- No page scrolling occurs when modals are open
- Consistent modal behavior across all components
- Better user experience with proper modal positioning

## Testing
- Tested on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verified no scrolling issues on the main page when modals are open
- Confirmed all modals remain centered and accessible
